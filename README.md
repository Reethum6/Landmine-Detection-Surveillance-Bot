# Landmine-Detection-Surveillance-Bot
Problem statement:

To enhance surveillance and operational efficiency and to
have safer and more efficient handling of dangerous tasks in
defence applications we need a robot that works 24/7 for
different types of works. To detect metal explosives and
alert, to include medical kit for assistance in emergencies.
To maintain critical communication through voice assistant.

APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM:

The ESP32 microcontroller is at the heart of this advanced semi-autonomous robot, which
can operate in both manual and automatic modes. Equipped with a suite of sensors, including
ultrasonic sensors and metal detectors, the robot can navigate autonomously by avoiding
obstacles and detecting land mines. The system integrates with IoT platforms like Blynk for
real-time monitoring and control, displaying comprehensive sensor data. Soldiers can manage
the robot remotely, switching modes and initiating patrol routes via the Blynk interface. An
ESP32 camera module offers live video feed capabilities, enhancing situational awareness. In
scenarios where communication via walkie-talkie is compromised, a voice assistant with IoT
support maintains critical communication. The robot's ability to operate 24/7 makes it an
invaluable patrolling bot.
